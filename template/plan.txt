EXPLORE:
--------

fetch data once per day? week? Month?
store fetched data in a file?
save fetched data as an object.
do/not fetch data based on changes? (object comparison)
recollect the opening and closing time of the events? (intelligent searching of the information fields)

DEVELOP:
--------

PROCESS/STORE THE DATA
(only when the calendar data is changed and retrieved)

> Detect the "outdoor" events

for each event in the array
    search the following strings for "outdoor","park" words and synonyms:
    - response[i].title
    - response[i].location
    loop
    - response[i].customFields[j].value["..."]
    ~response[i].customFields[j].label["Venue"] (value: "..." sibling of label: "venue")
    ~response[i].customFields[j].label["Event Type"] (value: "..." sibling of label: "venue")

> Add a property "outdoor" to each event (bool)

DISPLAY THE DATA
(each time a visitor opens the app)

> Narrow the list of events to the next 7 days:

for each event in the array
    for each of the seven next days dates
        if the considered date is within the event period:  date >= response[i].startDateTime && date < response[i].endDateTime (on a per day basis)
            record the event array index
            
> Filter the events to display based on set conditions
